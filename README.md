  ## Description
  This Employee Tracker application makes queries to a database of employees from a company so that the company can keep a record of its employees, roles, and departments, add to this record, and keep their records up to date as new employees are hired and roles change. Using the command-line interface, the user can view all departments, add a department, view all roles, add a role, view all employees, add an employee, and update an employee's role. The employees database contains three tables (department, role, and employee) that can be joined to view employees' names, roles, departments, salaries, and managers. This app uses inquirer to prompt the user for information about departments, roles, and employees when adding these to the database tables. MySQL2 is used to connect to the MySQL database. Also, console.table is used to display clean-looking tables from MySQL rows in the terminal.
